<h1><a NAME="link_intro"></a>1. Introduction</h1>

<p>OpenPTC (PTC) is a cross-platform graphics API that was developed to make writing games
and demos easy - and the result fast. What PTC will do for you is give you access to the
framebuffer of the platform you are on, manage offscreen buffers for you and convert these
buffers to whatever video format is available at that time. </p>

<p>This approach gives you the advantage that you can concentrate on writing your code for
one colour format (<i>32 bit RGB Truecolour </i>would be a good idea) and leave the rest
to PTC. You do not even have to worry about any speed losses when the format you use is
not available on the target platform - benchmarks show that PTC will convert a 32 bit
buffer to 16 bit faster than it can do a 32 bit to 32 bit copy (because less data has to
be transferred). </p>

<p>In the next few sections, I shall explain the basic use of PTC, how to get access to
the framebuffer, and so on. The structure of the document from now on is an evolutionary
one, from the basics to the details: 

<ul>
  <li>What is ... ? - describing the classes you will use</li>
  <li>How do I ... ? - showing you the ways of doing things with PTC</li>
  <li>Where is ... ? - some links you might care about</li>
  <li>What the f@$* ? - telling you where to ask any remaining questions :)</li>
</ul>

<p>One thing left to be said: <b>This page is useless if you do not look at the examples
included with the PTC distributions.</b> Look at some real code while you are browsing
through this, preferably look at the more simple examples such as &quot;Random&quot;,
&quot;Palette&quot; and some of the simpler demo programs such as &quot;Fire&quot; and
&quot;Tunnel&quot;.<br>
&nbsp; </p>

<hr WIDTH="100%">

<h1><a NAME="link_whatis"></a>2. What is ... ?</h1>

<h2><a NAME="link_whatis_format"></a>2.1 ... a Format ?</h2>

<p>The <i>Format </i>class hold information about how pixels are composed in a specific
framebuffer or offscreen buffer. When you use PTC, you will create instances of this class
to specify the format you want to use in your application and the format you want the
screen to have. PTC supports both indexed formats (e.g. 8 bit colour with a palette) and
direct formats (e.g. 16 bit rgb 565 or 32 bit RGB888). Click <a HREF="#link_howdoi_format">here</a>
for usage information on the Format class. <br>
&nbsp; </p>

<h2><a NAME="link_whatis_surface"></a>2.2 ... a Surface ?</h2>

<p>A <i>Surface </i>is a memory area (in system memory, not in video memory)&nbsp;that you
can draw into if you don't want to draw directly to the screen. If you draw into a
Surface, that gives you the advantage that the Surface will be automatically converted
from the colour format you chose to the colour format of the Console that has been opened.
In other words, if you use a Surface, you do not have to worry about converting your
pixels to the format made available by the OS. <br>
&nbsp; </p>

<h2><a NAME="link_whatis_console"></a>2.3 ... a Console ?</h2>

<p>The <i>Console </i>is your interface to the world. Is contains the routines to access
the framebuffer, and some simple keyboard routines. No matter what you do, you will always
(well, most of the time, anyway) have to create a Console object at some point. On most
systems, a Console will create a fullscreen display. On some (e.g. X11, DirectX if
requested) a window will be created. To you, it doesn't really matter very much, you won't
notice unless you perform special checks to ensure either working mode is used. <br>
One thing you should note is that <i>Console </i>and <i>Surface </i>have the same
baseclass in PTC, that is, a Console is of the same type as a Surface (namely they are
both Base Surfaces). This should tell you that most operations available for Surfaces are
also available for Consoles (e.g. you have to lock()&nbsp;both Consoles and Surfaces, more
later). <br>
&nbsp; </p>

<h2><a NAME="link_whatis_eh"></a>2.4 ... Exception Handling ?</h2>

<p>Exception handling is a very efficient way to handle errors in your applications. PTC
keeps exception handling to a minimum to avoid overhead because current C++ compilers
aren't too great at implementing it. Unless you decide otherwise, you will only have one
try/catch block in your application (wrapping your&nbsp; whole main() function). <br>
PTC uses a single class called <i>Error </i>to report exceptions. If an error occurs, this
can be caught and <i>Error::report()</i> will display the error and end the application.
Look at the examples, you will understand them immediately (er.. :) <br>
&nbsp; </p>

<h2><a NAME="link_whatis_int32"></a>2.5 ... this int32, short16, char8 business ?</h2>

<p>These types are defined to be the same size across all platforms. Here is what they are
supposed to be: 

<ul>
  <li>int32 = unsigned int, 4 bytes</li>
  <li>short16 = unsigned short, 2 bytes</li>
  <li>char8 = unsigned char, 1 byte</li>
</ul>

<p>We <b>strongly suggest that you use those types for all pixel manipulation</b>. Not
only will this guarantee that your application works on any architecture, it will also
prevent you from causing colour distortions through signed/unsigned incompatibilities. Not
long ago, I had to answer a question from someone who had used a char*&nbsp;instead of
char8*&nbsp;to draw his stuff and got his colours messed up (greetings to Nado&nbsp;:). </p>

<hr WIDTH="100%">

<h1><a NAME="link_howdoi"></a>3. How do I ... ?</h1>

<h2><a NAME="link_howdoi_format"></a>3.1 ... request my colour Format ?</h2>

<p>Before you can create a Console or a Surface, you have to decide on the colour format
you want to use in your routines. PTC offers you two different formats: 

<ul>
  <li>Indexed colour</li>
  <li>Direct colour</li>
</ul>

<p>Accordingly, there are two different constructors offered to create format objects of
the right type: 

<ul>
  <li><i>Format(int bits);</i></li>
  <li><i>Format(int bits, int32 r, int32 g, int32 b, int32 a=0);</i></li>
</ul>

<p>If you want an indexed colour mode, you have to use the first constructor. The converse
is true as well, for direct modes use the second constructor. Note that at the moment <b>only
8 bit indexed modes</b> are supported, so if you want an indexed colour mode, make sure
you pass 8 and nothing else to the constructor. In the second constructor, r, g, and b
stand for the bitmasks of the colour components, that is the mask you use on a pixel of
that format to select a single colour component. Look below for some common bitmasks. </p>

<p>By the way, for those who aren't too experienced with C++ yet, the <i>a=0</i> in the
second constructor means that this parameter may be omitted when creating a Format object
and will be set to 0 by default then. Enough talking, here are some examples: 

<ul>
  <li><i>Format myFormat(8);</i>&nbsp; // Creates an indexed 8 bit colour format (aka 256
    colours with a palette)</li>
  <li><i>Format myFormat(32,0xFF0000,0xFF00,0xFF); </i>// Creates a format for 32 bit
    truecolour mode</li>
</ul>

<p>I still owe you the most common bitmasks, here they are: 

<ul>
  <li>32 bit Truecolour: <i>Format(32,0xFF0000,0xFF00,0xFF)</i></li>
  <li>16 bit Direct Colour: <i>Format(16,0xF800,0x7E0,0x1F)</i></li>
  <li>15 bit Hicolour: <i>Format(16,0x7C00,0x3E0,0x1F) </i><b>Attention:</b> Note how 16 bit
    is passed to the constructor, not 15 bit. PTC always uses the actual number of bits used
    per pixel!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pitfalls</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Do NOT use any colour formats apart from 32 bit RGB 888, 16 bit RGB 565 or indexed 8 bit
    mode if you care about speed! These are the only formats for which optimised routines are
    available. All other formats will be converted using a slower generic conversion routine.
    We believe that those formats are the most sensible ones to use in any application.</li>
  <li>Do NOT pass anything but 8 to the constructor for indexed modes!</li>
</ul>

<h2><a NAME="link_howdoi_openconsole"></a>3.2 ... open a Console ?</h2>

<p>There are quite a few ways to open a Console, even some platform specific ones, but
those will not be discussed here (and are not normally needed). The first thing to do is
to get a Console object: </p>

<blockquote>
  <i><p>Console console;</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can now open the Console using one of the open routines. I will just show you the
cross-platform compatible way, there might be more detailed opening functions available to
fine tune your program for a target platform. Check out the PTC documentation for you
platform (which might or might not be included). Anyway, we will use the following open
routine: </p>

<blockquote>
  <i><p>void open(const char title[],int width,int height,Format &amp;format);</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The parameters you pass are the string to appear on the title bar if your program is
executed in a window (always pass a string, even if you compile under DOS), the width and
the height of the video mode you want to initialise, and the format you want the video
mode to have. Here is an example: </p>

<blockquote>
  <i><p>Format format(32,0xFF0000,0xFF00,0xFF);</i> </p>
  <p><i>Console console;</i> <br>
  <i>console.open(&quot;Hello PTC world&quot;,320,200,format);</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This will instruct PTC to try and initialise a 320x200 Truecolour mode. Note that there
is no guarantee that PTC will be able to initalise that mode. Normally, PTC will fall back
to the next worse mode if the requested mode is not available. If you want to draw
directly to the video memory later, you might care whether PTC did in fact initialise the
mode you wanted or if it fell back to a different mode. You can check by looking at the
Console's format and comparing it to the format you requested. </p>

<blockquote>
  <i><p>if(console.format()!=format) throw Error(&quot;I wanted exactly the format I
  requested. Now I'm angry&quot;);</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Normally, however, you will use a surface and leave the drawing to PTC so you shouldn't
worry what video mode got initialised. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; </p>

<h2><a NAME="link_howdoi_createsurface"></a>3.3 ... create a Surface ?</h2>

<p>Nothing is easier than creating a Surface to draw into. All you need to use is the
constructor of the Surface class: </p>

<blockquote>
  <i><p>Surface(int width,int height,const Format &amp;format);</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, if you want an offscreen surface of the same size as the Console in the previous
example, you would use: </p>

<blockquote>
  <i><p>Surface surface(320,200,format);</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>You should use the same format for the Console and the Surface. Anything else would be
a bit weird (although it is possible). <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; </p>

<h2><a NAME="link_howdoi_draw"></a>3.4 ... draw my stuff ?</h2>

<p>First of all, you have to decide how you want to render your things, that is: 

<ul>
  <li>a) into an offscreen surface</li>
  <li>b)&nbsp;directly into video memory (this is discouraged behaviour&nbsp;:)</li>
</ul>

<p>What should normally do is <b>draw into an offscreen surface.</b> Let's assume you
created a Surface object in 32 bit truecolour mode, the actual screen mode is - whatever,
it doesn't matter. Now you want to get your hands on the pixels, use the <i>lock() </i>function
to get a pointer to the Surface's pixel data - it is a void* pointer so you have to cast
it to whatever you want it to be: </p>

<blockquote>
  <i><p>int32 *dest;&nbsp; // Truecolour this time!</i> <br>
  <i>dest=(int32 *)surface.lock();</i> <br>
  <i>...</i> <br>
  <i>surface.unlock(); // Unlock the surface</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As opposed to a Console, a Surface <b>guarantees linear memory</b>, so you do not have
to use a pitch (look below)&nbsp;to get to the next scanline, just hardcode the width you
requested. So to put a pixel at (x/y) in a 320x200 surface, you can hardcode 320 as the
width: </p>

<blockquote>
  <i><p>int32 *dest=surface.lock();</i> <br>
  <i>*(dest+y*320+x)=0xffffff;</i> <br>
  <i>surface.unlock();</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Draw whatever you want into your surface. When you're finished, nothing will be on the
screen yet, you have to copy your beautifully rendered surface to the console - after
unlocking, etc: </p>

<blockquote>
  <i><p>surface.copy(console);</i> <br>
  <i>console.update();</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This will copy your Surface to the Console and convert the pixel formats as needed.
Note the call to console.update(), this is necessary so that things actually get shown on
the screen, don't leave it out. </p>

<p>If you decide to <b>draw directly to the console</b>, then good luck. You will have to
pray that your video mode is available and your application will only run in that specific
video mode. (It still makes sense in some cases, for instance you might want to support
only 8 bit indexed mode FOR WHATEVER REASON and disallow PTC to convert that mode to
what's available). In this case, you use the <i>lock()</i> function of the Console object
you allocated, in 8 bit indexed mode: </p>

<blockquote>
  <i><p>char8 *dest;</i> <br>
  <i>dest=(char8 *)console.lock();</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you are finished, <b>you have to unlock the console again!</b> And, while we are
at it, beware of the following major </p>

<h3>Big fat Pitfall</h3>

<p>When you draw directly to the Console, PTC cannot guarantee you that the video memory
is one big linear block of pixels. What PTC does guarantee is that every scanline is a
linear block of pixels. However, to get from one scanline to the next, you have to use the
<b>pitch</b> returned by the Console. The pitch is the amount of bytes you have to jump to
get from the start of one scanline to the next. Here is some example code that fills the
screen with random pixels in 8 bit colour mode: </p>

<blockquote>
  <i><p>char8 *dest;</i> <br>
  <i>dest=(char8 *)console.lock();</i> </p>
  <p><i>for(int j=0;i&lt;console.height();j++)</i> <br>
  <i>{ for(int i=0;i&lt;console.width();i++)</i> <br>
  <i>&nbsp; *(dest+j*console.pitch()+i)=random(255);</i> <br>
  <i>}</i> </p>
  <p><i>console.unlock(); // Release console lock</i> <br>
  <i>console.update(); // update the console (don't leave that one out)</i></p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Pitfalls</h3>

<p>This is the part of your code where you WILL make mistakes. There are some mistakes
which are made quite frequently, TAKE CARE to avoid them: 

<ul>
  <li><b>Again, when drawing directly to the Console, use the pitch!</b> Do not hardcode the
    width to get to the next scanline (look above)</li>
  <li><b>The pitch is in bytes, not in pixels. </b>So, therefore, take care to avoid pointer
    arithmetic mistakes! It you add the pitch to an int32*, you will end up moving 4 times
    further than you wanted to! You have to cast the pointer to char8*, then add the pitch and
    cast back!.</li>
  <li><b>When drawing directly to the Console, keep in mind the size may change</b>, even from
    one frame to the next (a user might resize the window, etc.). Therefore you will have to
    use the width()&nbsp;and height() function every time to determine the Console's
    dimension.</li>
  <li>Every <b>lock() has to be followed by an unlock()</b> eventually!</li>
  <li><b>Do NOT forget to call surface.update()</b> when you are finished drawing !</li>
  <li><b>Do NOT forget to copy the surface to the console</b> ! (Ok, that one is a bit stupid,
    who'd forget about that? :)</li>
</ul>
