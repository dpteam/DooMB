<h4><br>
<font face="Arial">import</font></h4>

<ul>
  <li>You use this script to generate import libraries so that you can link to the OpenPTC
    dynamic link libaries.</li>
  <li>This script generates the input libraries &quot;ptc.lib&quot; and
    &quot;ptcdebug.lib&quot; for your compiler so that you can link to &quot;ptc.dll&quot; and
    &quot;debug.dll&quot;.</li>
  <li>See the <a href="compiler.html">Compiler Instructions</a> page for compiler specific
    instructions on how to generate the import libraries for your compiler.</li>
</ul>

<h4><font face="Arial">build</font></h4>

<ul>
  <li>This script is for building an example or demo program, it is capable of building
    programs with a single source .c or .cpp file, not multiple files.</li>
  <li>To use the build script, simply change to the directory of the example program and
    execute the script.</li>
  <li>The syntax of the build script is as follows: <em>build name [release|debug]
    [windows|console]</em></li>
  <li>The first parameter is manditory, the others are optional.</li>
  <li>The name parameter is the name of the program, ie. you would type &quot;build
    random&quot; to build the random example (random.cpp to random.exe).</li>
  <li>The second parameter determines what build you want. A release build means that the
    output is optimized and links to &quot;ptc.dll&quot;. A debug build is not optimized,
    contains debugging information and links to &quot;ptcdebug.dll&quot;. If this parameter is
    omitted then it defaults to release.</li>
  <li>The third parameter selects the type of executable to be output. A windows executable is
    'normal'. This means, it just starts with a WinMain and performs all of its output by
    creating windows. A console application is like a dos application, it runs in a command
    prompt and pipes stdout there. Do not confuse this a console application and the OpenPTC
    console, they are not related.</li>
  <li>In most circumstances you will want a windows application, however for some example
    programs (&quot;Info&quot;, &quot;Mode&quot; etc.) that output using printf or cout then
    you if want to actually see the text output then you have to create a console application.</li>
  <li>Typically, console applications start with &quot;int main()&quot; and windows
    applications start with &quot;WinMain(...)&quot;.</li>
</ul>
